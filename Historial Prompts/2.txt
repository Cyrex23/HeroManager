Alright, I was able to run the application and overall I liked everything and the UI for now. 
However there are some things that don't work. 
-Under team lineup, it is showing "Failed to load team data." in red.
-After sucessfully buying heroes they're not showing at "Bench Heroes"
-Also after buying heroes, in the section Shop/Abilities, in the select hero dropwdown, it doesn't show the heroes that I have bought to select.
-I don't see konohamaru as a starter hero anywhere, it was an initial requirement
-When I registered I've sucessfuly got the confirmation email and the link button worked. However it redirected me to the page that says: "This confirmation link has already been used." so it was confusing. Tell him that the email was sucessfully confirmed.

Things to change:
-Lets do a small modification, when a player logs in for the first time in 3 hours, lets give to that player 20 minutes of online, so that players up in the arena as online.
-Check this @hexagonal diagram.png , I want to show the grow stats witha hexagonal diagram, with eatch attribute at each point of the hexagonal.
